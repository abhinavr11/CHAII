# CHAII - Challenge in AI for India 2021
## Google Research

Predicting answers to questions is a common NLU task, but not for Hindi and Tamil. Current progress on multilingual modeling requires a concentrated effort to generate 
high-quality datasets and modelling improvements. Additionally, for languages that are typically underrepresented in public datasets,it can be difficult to build trustworthy 
evaluations. We hope the training data provided for this competition and other datasets generated by participants will enable future machine learning for Indic languages.
